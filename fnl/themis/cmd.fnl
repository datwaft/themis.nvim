(lambda command! [name command ...]
  "Create a new user command using the vim.api.nvim_create_user_command API.

  Accepts the following arguments:
  name -> must be a symbol.
  command -> can be an string, a symbol, a function or a quoted expression.
  ... -> a list of options. The valid boolean options are the following:
         - force
         - bang
         - bar
         - register
         - keepscript
         These options can be prepended by 'no' to set them to false.
         The last option that doesn't have a pair and is not boolean will become the description.

  Example of use:
  ```fennel
  (command! Salute '(print \"Hello World\")
            :bang \"This is a description\")
  ```
  That compiles to:
  ```fennel
  (vim.api.nvim_create_user_command \"Salute\" (fn [] (print \"Hello World\"))
