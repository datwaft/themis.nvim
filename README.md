![tests workflow](https://github.com/datwaft/themis.nvim/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

Fennel macros for hotpot.nvim created for my personal Neovim configuration.

**Warning:** these macros were created for my personal configuration so they
will follow my opinion. If you want to use them I recommend you to fork them or
copy them as they can be changed at any moment.

## FAQ

### Why was this repository created?

I wanted to have unit testing for my macros and the best way was to create
a new repository and isolate them from my configuration.

### Where does the name come from?

The name comes from the ancient Greek titan of justice, divine order, law and custom.

I choose this name because this plugin brings order to my Neovim configuration.

See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themis> for more information.
